-   Delta tracking windowed multi-pole
-   NURBS tallies (using KDEs)
-   Random Ray for weight window generation
-   FET uncertainties
-   Universe based maj
-   Universe volume calculations for selection of delta tracking vs surface tracking
-   Avg chord length vs mfp tracking
-   Arbitrary isotope reaction rate tallies in depletion solver
-   Nuclide temperatures
-   Custom source for on the fly neutron source from charged particle code
-   Source cell rejection  
-   Compute majorant in Python side?
