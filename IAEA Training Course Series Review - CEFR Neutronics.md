Notes on a review of a TCS document for the IAEA

## CEFR: China Experimental Fast Reactor

High-level design notes:
 - 65 MWth (20MWe) pool-type sodium-cooled fast reactor
 - UO2 fuel
- Inlet temperature: 360 °C, outlet temp: 530 °C
- sub-assemblies are fixed at the bottome w/ spacers at the top to accomodate expansion

### Startup Tests
- approach to critical by replacing mock fuel assemblies with real ones
	- last real assembly is just enough to overcome geometric buckling
- next control rod worth is measured
	- for clean core, measured at 3 different locations, critical insertion depth is then extrapolated from a control rod worth curve

### Control Rod Worth Tests
- For a given configuration of all control rods in the core, one is moved and the reactivity difference is measured

$$ \rho = \frac{|k^{after}_{eff} - k^{before}_{eff}|}
{k^{after}_{eff} \times k^{before}_{eff}} \times 10^{5} (pcm$$
