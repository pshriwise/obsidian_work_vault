#### Plan for adding CubicSpline interpolations in OpenMC

Cubic spline interpolation requires a transformation of the input data (x and y values of the interpolated function) to the set of coefficients used to represent the continuous cubic function spanning the points. This requires $4(n-1)$ constraining equations and, more importantly, a matrix solver to get those coefficients. Since we'd like to avoid adding a Matrix solver to OpenMC, my plan is to use the `scipy.interpolate` module to generate a `CubicSpline` class that contains the coefficients. These will be written to XML and read into the C++ code to be used for interpolation during simulation.
