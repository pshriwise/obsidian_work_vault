#### Plan for adding CubicSpline interpolations in OpenMC

Cubic spline interpolation requires a transformation of the input data (x and y values of the interpolated function) to the set of coefficients used to represent the continuous cubic function spanning the points. This requires $4(n-1)$ constraining equations and, more importantly, a matrix solver to get those coefficients. Since we'd like to avoid adding a Matrix solver to OpenMC, my plan is to use the `scipy.interpolate` module to generate a `CubicSpline` class that contains the coefficients. These will be written to XML and read into the C++ code to be used for interpolation during simulation.

Update: it turns out that there are already several functions in OpenMC that provide cubic spline evaluation and interpolation of datasets. These are needed for the thick-target Bremsstrahlung evaluation in electron transport. Assuming that the correct interpolation is used here, I'll leverage those functions to generate the correct 2nd order derivatives at each data point that will allow for fast interpolation of the `EnergyFunctionFilter` values during tallying.

#### On the ICRP interpolation type

The [USER GUIDE TO THE ICRP CD AND THE DECDATA SOFTWARE](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1016/j.icrp.2008.10.001?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.2) indicates that a hermite cubic interpolation is used for some datasets.
