### Development Task List
- [ ] Refactor interpolation code
- [ ] Add remaining interpolation schemes to `EnergyFunctionFilter`


### `EnergyFunctionFiler` Interpolation

### Interpolation Refactor
Interpolation is used in many places in OpenMC. The formulat for linear interpolation appears many times. Something like:

```cpp
double f = (x - x0) / (x1 - x0);
double val = y0 + f * (y1 - y0);
```

I'd like to refactor this to minimize duplication of code. One challenge with this is that the interpolation factor, `f`, is often computed and used for multiple interpolations (for computing cross section values at multiple temperatures, for example).

```cpp
double f = (x - x0) / (x1 - x0);
double val1 = ya0 + f * (ya1 - ya0);
double val2 = yb0 + f * (yb1 - yb0);
...
```

So a function that performs the entire interpolation isn't paticularly useful as we'd be recomputing this interpolation factor many times. I think I'd like to try this with some kind of templated structure that is designed to be temporary.

## Interpolation Use Cases

There are a number of places where interpolation occurs in OpenMC. All are done manually now, with the index search, interpolation factor, and interpolation occuring in different locations depending on the need. I'll try to enumerate all of the interpolation use cases in OpenMC here:

1. Standard interpolation -- index, interpolation factor, and interpolated value are all computed in one place
2. One X grid, multiple interpolations -- in this case, an index and interpolation factor are computed, but the interpolation occurs for different Y grids.
3. Interpolation over sub-grid -- in some cases, the interpolation occurs over a subset of the full grid, so the constructors for interpolation need to accomodate this case.

## Implementation Plan
To keep the lines of code minimal for one-off interpolations, there might be two `struct`'s: `Interpolator` and `FixedInterpolator`.

  - `Interpolator` will perform a full interpolation based on the scheme specified
  - `FixedInterpolator` will perform a partial interpolation and hang around to be used for subsequent interpolations


```cpp
struct FixedInterpolator<T> {

	// computes interpolation factor(s) based on domain array and value
	FixedInterpolator(const std::vector<double>& xs, double x);

	// applies interpolation based on data that is expected to correspond
	// to the domain array
	double operator ()(const std::vector<double>& ys);

	size_t idx;
	double interpolation_factor_;
};
```

```cpp
struct Interpolate<T> {
	static double operator()(const std::vector<double>& xs, 
	                         const std::vector<double&> ys,
	                         double x);	
}
```

In practice their use would look like:

```cpp
auto fi = FixedInterpolator<Interpolation::lin_lin>(xs, x);

double val1 = fi(ya);
double val2 = fi(yb);
```

```cpp
double val = Interpolate<Interpolation::lin_lin>(xs, ys, x);
```

This will be really nice to turn blocks of code from:
```cpp
switch (interpolation_) {
    case Interpolation::lin_lin:
        // interpolate
        break;
    case Interpolation::lin_log:
	    // interpolate
	    break;
    case Interpolation::log_lin:
	    // interpolate
	    break;
    case Interpolation::log_log:
	    // interpolate
	    break;
	case Interpolation::quadratic:
	    // interpolate
	    break;
	case Interpolation::cubic:
		//interpolate
		break;
	default:
		fatal_error("Unrecognized interpolation");
}
```

into
```cpp
double val = Interpolate<interpolation_>(xs, ys, x);
```

With specialized implementations of the templates that will result in errors for an invalid `Interpolation` type.

#### Plan for adding CubicSpline interpolations in OpenMC

Cubic spline interpolation requires a transformation of the input data (x and y values of the interpolated function) to the set of coefficients used to represent the continuous cubic function spanning the points. This requires $4(n-1)$ constraining equations and, more importantly, a matrix solver to get those coefficients. Since we'd like to avoid adding a Matrix solver to OpenMC, my plan is to use the `scipy.interpolate` module to generate a `CubicSpline` class that contains the coefficients. These will be written to XML and read into the C++ code to be used for interpolation during simulation.

Update: it turns out that there are already several functions in OpenMC that provide cubic spline evaluation and interpolation of datasets. These are needed for the thick-target Bremsstrahlung evaluation in electron transport. Assuming that the correct interpolation is used here, I'll leverage those functions to generate the correct 2nd order derivatives at each data point that will allow for fast interpolation of the `EnergyFunctionFilter` values during tallying.

#### On the ICRP interpolation type

The [USER GUIDE TO THE ICRP CD AND THE DECDATA SOFTWARE](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1016/j.icrp.2008.10.001?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.2) indicates that a hermite cubic interpolation is used for some datasets.
